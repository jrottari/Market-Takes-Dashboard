# Market-Takes-Dashboard
This is a repository with data and Tableau dashboard insired by WSJ's youtube series "Market Takes" and commonly reported economic indicators that one reads about in the news. The R code used to aquire and format the data in a nice way is included and may be of use to anyone interested in analazying similar economic data or creating a similar dashboard. The dashboard is intended to provide conveniently displayed economic data that may be of interest to individuals and business that do not want to repeatdly google to find disjoint data and visulations published by the BLS, the Federal Reserve, or other instutions. This dashboard isn't focused on investing, but does include one visualization for my preferred guage of a stock being over or under valued - the Shiller PE ratio.
