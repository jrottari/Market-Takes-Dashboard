This is a repository with data and Tableau dashboard insired by WSJ's youtube series "Market Takes" and commonly reported economic indicators that one reads about in the news. My main inspiration is to provide convenient visulations that help any viewer guage the current state of the U.S. economy relative to other periods in history without having to depend on, what often seem like isolated, unmeaningful data points as reported in the news. The dashboard is intended to provide conveniently displayed economic data that may be of interest to individuals and business that do not want to repeatedly google to find disjoint data and visulations published by the BLS, the Federal Reserve, or other instutions without being able to make meaningful connections among the data. What I've done is merely of an exploritory nature, but I believe it's useful for understanding the overall health of the U.S. economy. This dashboard isn't focused on investing, but does include one visualization for my preferred guage of a stock being over or under valued - the Shiller PE ratio. 

The R code used to aquire and format the data in a nice way is included and may be of use to anyone interested in analazying similar economic data or creating a similar dashboard. The code may also be of use to anyone looking to access and easily format BLS data via their API.
